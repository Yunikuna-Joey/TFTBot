# TFTBot

Starting the initial construction of a Discord Bot that will retrieve player statistics about a particular gamemode (TeamFight Tactics) for the time being. 

I will start by creating a bot that will live in Discord. 


- Create a virtual environment 
  - ** Windows **:  "py -m venv 'custom_name' "
  - ** Mac **:  "python -m venv 'custom_name' "
